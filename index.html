<h2>Quotations</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Prototype but Verify.
</p><p class="cite"> --- John D. Ramsdell, VLISP Motto, 1995
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  There are two ways of constructing a software design.
  One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously
  no deficiencies.  And the other way is to make it so
  complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
</p><p class="cite"> --- C.A.R. Hoare
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
  <em>computer</em> what to do, let us concentrate rather on
  explaining to <em>human beings</em> what we want a computer to do.
</p><p class="cite"> --- Donald Knuth on writing software
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  A distributed system is one that stops you from getting any work
  done when a machine you've never even heard of crashes.
</p><p class="cite"> --- Leslie Lamport
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  I have always wished for my computer to be as easy to use as my
  telephone; my wish has come true because I can no longer figure out
  how to use my telephone.
</p><p class="cite"> --- Bjarne Stroustrup
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Open formats are at the very heart of
  our democratic process.  The question is whether a sovereign state
  has the obligation to ensure that its public documents remain
  forever free and unencumbered by patent, license, or other
  technical impediments.  We say, yes, this is an imperative.
  Microsoft says they disagree and want the world to use their
  proprietary formats.

</p><p class="cite"> --- Eric Kriss, the Massachusetts Secretary of
Administration and Finance
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Perfection is not achieved when there is nothing left to
  add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
</p><p class="cite"> --- Antoine de St. Exupery
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Men never do evil so cheerfully and so completely as when
  they do it from religious conviction.
</p><p class="cite"> --- Blaise Pascal

</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  A big book is a big evil.
</p><p class="cite"> --- Gotthold Lessing

</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  I went to a general store.  They wouldn't let me buy
  anything specifically.
</p><p class="cite"> --- Stephen Wright
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Feel life.
</p><p class="cite"> --- Ramsdell's Maxim
</p></blockquote>
