<p>The wonderful thing about Scheme is: <br>
Scheme is a wonderful thing. <br>
Complex procedural ideas <br>
Are expressed via simple strings. <br>
Its clear semantics, and lack of pedantics, <br>
Help make programs run, run, RUN! <br>
But the most wonderful thing about Scheme is: <br>
Programming in it is fun, <br>
Programming in it is FUN!</p>
